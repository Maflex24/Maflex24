- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music (heavy metal, eurodance, and more, I'm open), motorcycles (most cruisers), and of course programming! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to 'master' javascript, then I'll move to frameworks, APIs, python and more. I just want to get things together, front-end, and backend, have possibility to create web app, where I can do something and save result in database. Maybe game, maybe some note app, doesn't matter.
